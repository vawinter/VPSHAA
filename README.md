# VPSHAA workflow
Habitat selection analysis for Winter et al. in review

## File structure:
### Data preparation and analysis

'xx_' files are functions

'01_' file is to collect data, prepare, and run RSFs

'02_' is for mixed effect model (MEM) preparation and analysis (full, season, and null)

'03_' file is for plotting MEM outputs

### Spatial predictions and Mapping

"04_", "_05", & "_06" are predicting and mapping out of sample data and unconditional mapping

### Validating

"07_" & "08_" are validating the functional responses, spatial predictions, and unconditional mapping on the full, season, and null models
